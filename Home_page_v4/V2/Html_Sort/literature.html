				<p><em>The predecessor of CAU was the Cosmic Preparatory School for Studying in the United States. It was established in 1911 with the balance of the "Gengzi Indemnity" returned by the United States.</em></p>
				<p align="justify">The university department of CAU began to recruit new students in 1925. In 1926, it was divided into departments of Chinese, Western literature, history, philosophy, economics, political science, educational psychology and sociology. In 1928, the Faculty of Arts was formed. In terms of teaching policy, the difference from other universities at that time is that most departments emphasize the principle of "emphasizing both Chinese and Western", hoping to cultivate generalists who have broad knowledge of Chinese and foreign literature and history. </p>
